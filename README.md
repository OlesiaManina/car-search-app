# Rental car application
Welcome!

This Ukrainian application was created to help users find a rental car according to their needs. The application was developed using React, Redux/Redux Toolkit, and Mockapi.io for asynchronous data fetching.

The application consists of three pages: Home, Catalog, and Favorites. On the Catalog and Favorites pages, user will find a list of advertisements for rental cars. Each advertisement includes a car image and essential information. By clicking on the "Learn More" button, a modal window opens, providing more detailed information about the selected car.

Users can also mark some advertisements as favorites, which will be saved and can be accessed on the Favorites page. Additionally, a search form has been implemented, allowing users to search for cars by model, price, or mileage. Please note that search information disappears after a page refresh.

In the future, the application's functionality may be extended to offer even more features. Enjoy using it!
